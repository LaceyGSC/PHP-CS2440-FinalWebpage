            <div id="aboutMeText">
                I am a 22 year old Computer Science student, currently enrolled in<br>
                my final semester at Salt Lake Community College. After three years, I will<br>
                have my associates in Computer Science and Information Systems<br>
                <br>
                <br>
                <h3>Hobbies</h3>
                
                I enjoy gaming, and I am a very big fan of RPG's and puzzle games.<br>
                I like to read, mostly fantasy and sci-fi, and the occasional thriller<br>
                if I am in the mood for one. On the more energetic side, I prefer to walk<br>
                and to do yoga.
                <br>
                <br>
                <br>
                <h3>Favorites</h3>
                
                I am a huge action movie fan. I can't really enjoy fantasy movies, funnily enough,<br>
                but give me some mindless violence and I can watch that over and over.<br>
                My current go to favorites are The Losers, RED (1 and 2), and the Bourne Legacy.<br>
                <br>
                Fantasy TV shows are much better than movies, for some reason. I'm really into Grimm, and<br>
                the new series, The Librarians, is surprisingly good for how cheesy it comes off<br>
                On the other end of the spectrum, I can't wait for the blacklist to return!<br>
                <br>
                
                <h3>Plans</h3>
                My goal after this semester is to move on to the University of Utah in order<br>
                to get my bachelor's in Computer Science, and then hopefully in Software<br>
                Engineering. Long term, I think I would like to go into something along the <br>
                lines of defense contracting or biotechnology. They are both fields that I think<br>
                have some very exciting possibilities.<br>
